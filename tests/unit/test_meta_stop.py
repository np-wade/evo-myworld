"""Guards the meta agent's contract in the optimize workflow.

The meta (formerly "analyst") is the concurrent controller. It (1) STOPs doomed
experiments — a diagnosed, recoverable stop carrying exp + failure class + reason
+ fix, acted on by a gated enforcer (not the meta itself); (2) suggests next
directions (briefHints); and (3) restructures the workflow itself live via
harnessEdits (logic flow + prompts), applied free-will and audited.

These are string-contract checks over the workflow source — they pin the
behaviour without booting the full runtime.
